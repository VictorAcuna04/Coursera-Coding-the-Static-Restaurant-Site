# Module 3 Solution - Food, LLC

This is my solution for Module 3 Coding Assignment of the Coursera course: "HTML, CSS, and Javascript for Web Developers" by Johns Hopkins University.

## Assignment Overview

The goal of this assignment was to create a responsive website for a fictional restaurant called "Food, LLC" using the Bootstrap CSS Framework. The site implements:

- A responsive design that works on mobile, tablet, and desktop devices
- A navigation bar with a brand name and a mobile menu dropdown
- A main content area with sections for different food categories

## Features Implemented

### Required (Graded) Features:

- Navbar that scrolls away with the page
- Brand name "Food, LLC" aligned to the left
- Mobile dropdown menu with 3 items (only visible on mobile)
- Centered page heading using Bootstrap class
- Content sections with sufficient height to force scrolling

### Optional (Ungraded) Features:

- Three different content sections (Chicken, Beef, Sushi)
- Equal width columns in desktop view
- Responsive layout that changes for tablet and mobile views
- "Back to Top" links at the end of each section
- Section headings centered within each section
- Detailed content in each section

## Technologies Used

- HTML5
- CSS3
- Bootstrap 3.3.7
- jQuery (for Bootstrap's JavaScript components)

## Responsive Behavior

- **Desktop View**: Three equal columns (all menu sections side by side)
- **Tablet View**: First two sections in the first row, third section in the second row
- **Mobile View**: Each section takes up the full width, with a navigation dropdown menu
